# internship

Required modules:

pip install chatterbot
pip install chatterbot-corpus
pip install gTTS
pip install SpeechRecognition
pip install pyaudio
--------------------------------------------
AIM:
the aim of this project was to make a program that can be a two way communication between an user and a computer
the computer should be able to hold basic conversation
----------------------------------------------
PRINCIPLE:
in breif the way this program works is by thaking the 'speech' input from the user converting it to text and then going through the 'chat_bot' pretrained model to get a text based 
response from the computer,this is then converted into an audio file and given as output.
----------------------------------------------
CHALLENGES:
the major difficulty while doing this project was installing the modules.
Some of the required modules do not work with python 3.8 or 3.9 and are only supported by the previous versions.
Some of the modules do not have any developement.
Modules like playsound could not be installed on google colab.
and the main module of this project i.e chatterbot could not be installed on the computer but could be done easily on colab.
